Hospital Patient Care Management System (HPCMS)
Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Version: 1.0
Date: 12 Nov 2025
Course: Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)

1. Overview
The Hospital Patient Care Management System (HPCMS) is a console-based C++ application that simulates peak-hour operations in a hospital. The system showcases the correct use of fundamental data structures (Queue, Stack, Priority Queue, Circular Queue) to manage patients, medical supplies, emergency cases, and ambulance dispatching.

The system is built by a team of four students. Each student owns one operational role and implements three functionalities using a specific core data structure. All modules are integrated into a single menu-driven program.

2. Objectives
- Demonstrate practical understanding of custom-built data structures (without STL containers).
- Map real-world hospital workflows to appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- Develop readable, modular, and maintainable C++ code.
- Provide an integrated system that supports multiple roles through a single interface.
- Prepare students to justify design decisions in an individual recorded demonstration.

3. In-Scope
- Single C++ console application with a main menu and submenus per role.
- Four functional modules:
  1) Patient Admission Clerk
  2) Medical Supply Manager
  3) Emergency Department Officer
  4) Ambulance Dispatcher
- Custom implementation of the following data structures:
  - Queue (array or linked list)
  - Stack (array or linked list)
  - Priority Queue (e.g., array/heap-based or ordered list)
  - Circular Queue (array-based)
- Basic persistence via in-memory data structures (no database required).
- Optional simple file I/O (.txt or .csv) if the team decides to persist data during runtime.

4. Out-of-Scope
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) frameworks.
- Networking or multi-user support.
- Use of C++ STL containers such as std::vector, std::list, std::queue, std::stack, std::priority_queue.
- Real-time integration with hospital systems or external APIs.

5. Stakeholders and Roles
- Lecturer / Examiner: Evaluates correctness, design, code quality, and explanation.
- Students (4 team members): Each owns one role/module.
  - Role A: Patient Admission Clerk – Queue
  - Role B: Medical Supply Manager – Stack
  - Role C: Emergency Department Officer – Priority Queue
  - Role D: Ambulance Dispatcher – Circular Queue

6. System-Level Requirements

6.1 Functional Requirements (Global)
FR-G1: The system shall display a main menu that allows the user to select one of the four roles or exit the program.
FR-G2: The system shall route the user to a role-specific submenu after the role is selected.
FR-G3: The system shall validate user input (e.g., menu choices) and show appropriate error messages.
FR-G4: The system shall loop back to the relevant menu after completing an operation, until the user chooses to go back or exit.
FR-G5: The system shall be implemented entirely in C++ using custom-built data structures.

6.2 Non-Functional Requirements
NFR-1: Usability – Menus, prompts, and messages shall be clear and user-friendly (no cryptic abbreviations).
NFR-2: Reliability – Operations shall handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., dequeue/pop on empty structures).
NFR-3: Performance – Basic operations (enqueue, dequeue, push, pop, insert, extract) should run in O(1) or O(log n) as appropriate.
NFR-4: Maintainability – The code shall be modular, with separate header (.hpp) and source (.cpp) files for each data structure and role.
NFR-5: Readability – Code shall follow consistent indentation and naming conventions, with comments describing major functions and structures.
NFR-6: Portability – The program shall compile and run on the lab environment C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or similar).

7. Module Requirements

7.1 Patient Admission Clerk (Queue)
Core Data Structure: Queue (FIFO)

FR-P1: The system shall allow the user to admit a patient by entering at least:
       - Patient ID
       - Patient Name
       - Condition Type (e.g., General, Surgery, Maternity)
FR-P2: The system shall store each new patient at the rear of the queue.
FR-P3: The system shall discharge the earliest admitted patient (front of the queue) when requested.
FR-P4: The system shall show an appropriate message if discharge is requested when no patients are available.
FR-P5: The system shall display the current queue of patients in arrival order (front to rear).

Data Structure Requirements:
DS-PQ1: Implement a queue using an array or linked list with front and rear indicators.
DS-PQ2: Provide operations: enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, isFull (if array-based), and display.

7.2 Medical Supply Manager (Stack)
Core Data Structure: Stack (LIFO)

FR-S1: The system shall allow adding a new medical supply entry with:
       - Supply Type (e.g., Mask, Glove, Medicine)
       - Quantity
       - Batch/Reference ID
FR-S2: The system shall push each new supply entry onto the top of the stack.
FR-S3: The system shall “use” the last added supply by popping from the top of the stack.
FR-S4: The system shall show an appropriate message if a pop is requested when the stack is empty.
FR-S5: The system shall display the current list of supplies from top to bottom.

Data Structure Requirements:
DS-SS1: Implement a stack using an array or linked list with a top index/pointer.
DS-SS2: Provide operations: push, pop, peek/top, isEmpty, isFull (if array-based), and display.

7.3 Emergency Department Officer (Priority Queue)
Core Data Structure: Priority Queue

FR-E1: The system shall allow logging a new emergency case with:
       - Case ID or Patient Name
       - Case Type (e.g., Accident, Cardiac, Trauma)
       - Priority Level (e.g., integer where higher value = more critical)
FR-E2: The system shall insert each new case into the priority queue based on priority.
FR-E3: The system shall process the most critical case by removing the highest-priority entry.
FR-E4: If two cases share the same priority, the system may process the earlier inserted case first (tie-breaking rule).
FR-E5: The system shall display all pending emergency cases in descending order of priority.
FR-E6: The system shall show an appropriate message if processing is requested when there are no emergency cases.

Data Structure Requirements:
DS-EP1: Implement a priority queue using either:
        - Binary heap (array-based), or
        - Sorted array/list (insertion keeps order).
DS-EP2: Provide operations: insert, extractHighestPriority, peek, isEmpty, and display.
DS-EP3: Document chosen time complexity and design trade-offs for use in the presentation.

7.4 Ambulance Dispatcher (Circular Queue)
Core Data Structure: Circular Queue

FR-A1: The system shall allow registering a new ambulance with:
       - Ambulance ID
       - Driver/Team Name
       - Status or Region (optional)
FR-A2: The system shall store ambulances in a circular queue to represent their shift rotation.
FR-A3: The system shall “rotate” the shift by moving the current front ambulance to the rear, making the next ambulance the new front.
FR-A4: The system shall display the current circular schedule of ambulances in order of dispatch.
FR-A5: The system shall show an appropriate message when rotation is requested but there are no ambulances registered.

Data Structure Requirements:
DS-AQ1: Implement a circular queue using an array with front and rear indices and modulo arithmetic.
DS-AQ2: Provide operations: enqueue, dequeue, rotate (dequeue then enqueue), isEmpty, isFull, and display.

8. User Interface & Interaction Flow

8.1 Main Menu (Example)
1. Patient Admission Clerk
2. Medical Supply Manager
3. Emergency Department Officer
4. Ambulance Dispatcher
5. Exit

8.2 Submenu Example (Patient Admission Clerk)
1. Admit Patient
2. Discharge Patient
3. View Patient Queue
4. Back to Main Menu

Similar submenus shall be provided for the other three roles.

9. Data Validation & Error Handling
- The system shall validate menu choices to ensure they are within the allowed range.
- The system shall prevent operations on empty structures (e.g., pop from empty stack, dequeue from empty queue) and report this to the user.
- The system shall handle simple type mismatches (e.g., non-numeric input where numbers are expected) using safe input reading and clearing the input buffer where possible.

10. Implementation Constraints
- Programming Language: C++
- No STL containers for the core data structures. Arrays and manually implemented nodes (for linked lists) are allowed.
- Project Structure (recommended):
  - main.cpp – main menu and high-level control flow
  - queue.hpp / queue.cpp – generic queue implementation (or specific patient queue)
  - stack.hpp / stack.cpp – supply stack implementation
  - priorityqueue.hpp / priorityqueue.cpp – emergency priority queue implementation
  - circularqueue.hpp / circularqueue.cpp – ambulance circular queue implementation
  - role-specific files (optional) such as patient_module.cpp, supply_module.cpp, etc.

11. Testing Requirements
- Each role owner shall prepare test scenarios for:
  - Normal operations (typical enqueue/push/insert, etc.)
  - Boundary conditions (e.g., empty structure, full array-based structure).
  - Example sequences that show correct ordering/priority behavior.
- Manual testing using console input/output is sufficient for this assignment.

12. Success Criteria
The assignment is considered successful if:
- All four roles are implemented and accessible via a single integrated menu.
- Each module uses the correct, custom-implemented data structure.
- The system behaves correctly for representative input sequences and edge cases.
- Each team member can clearly explain:
  - Their chosen data structure
  - How it works (operations and complexity)
  - Why it is appropriate for their role
- The project is submitted as a single ZIP file with all required source files.
- Each member submits an individual recording demonstrating their part of the system and answering Q&A.
